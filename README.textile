h1. PHP OpenID

This is a forked PHP OpenID library from PHP OpenID library by JanRain, Inc.
You can visit their website for more information about
their package and other OpenID implementations and tools:

  http://www.openidenabled.com/

h2. GETTING STARTED

First, run the 'examples/detect.php' script either from the command
line or via the web.  It will generate a report of any system
configuration changes necessary to run the library.


h2. INSTALLATION

h3. dependencies

h4. php

You will need PHP 5.0.0 or greater to use this library. 
JanRain has tested the library Linux on PHP 5.0.5, and 5.1.1. JanRain
has tested the library on Windows XP on PHP 4.4.4.
I have tested with PHP 5.3.4

h4. Required libraries

* Enable either the GMP extension or Bcmath extension. (GMP is STRONGLY
recommended because it's MUCH faster!)  This is required.
* Enable the CURL extension.
* Enable DOM extension ( provided in PHP core since PHP 5.0.0 )

h4. Optional libraries

* If you plan to use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL to store OpenIDdata,
you can use PEAR DB or MDB2 and the approriate extension.

* If you plan to use Memcache compliant database to store OpenID data,
you can use memcache or memcached extension.

h3. Installation process

h4. brute installation 

* Copy the Auth/ directory into your PHP include path.


h2. TESTING YOUR SETUP

You can use the example code to test your setup.  To run the example
consumer or server, follow the instructions in the examples/README
file.

h2. USING THE API

The best way to get started using the API is to take a look at the
example consumer and server in the examples/ directory.  See the
examples/README file for more details.

h2. TROUBLESHOOTING

* If you're unable to use an OpenID URL with the library, you may want
to try using the discover tool (examples/discover.php).  This tool
will perform OpenID discovery on the identifier and give a list of
discovered OpenID services and their types.

* On some systems, PHP basedir restrictions prevent web servers from
opening a source of randomness, such as /dev/urandom.  If your PHP
OpenID library has trouble getting a satisfactory source of
randomness, check your Apache and PHP configurations to be sure that
the randomness source is in the list of allowed paths for the
"open_basedir" option.

* In some cases, bugs in the GMP math library will result in signature
validation errors when using this library.  Since GMP is preferred
over bcmath (for performance), you will have to define
Auth_OpenID_BUGGY_GMP in your application *before* importing any of
the library code:

  @ define('Auth_OpenID_BUGGY_GMP', true); @

* Not all PHP installations support SSL.  You can find out if yours
supports SSL by reading the "HTTP Fetching" section of the output of
"examples/detect.php."  If your installation does not support SSL,
then https:// identity URLs and server URLs will not be supported by
the library.  An attempt to use such an identity URL will be
equivalent to using an invalid OpenID.  To enable SSL support,
recompile PHP with OpenSSL support or install the appropriate OpenSSL
module for your platform.  If you are using CURL, CURL will need to be
built with OpenSSL support.
